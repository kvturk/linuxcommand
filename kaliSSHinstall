In this article, I’m going to share how to install & enable SSh on Kali Linux.

Table of Contents
Install SSH
Enable and Start
Allow Root Access
Install SSH
To install SSH, run this command:

# update system
sudo apt-get update

# install SSH
sudo apt-get install ssh
Enable and Start
To enable SSH after rebooting system, run this command:

sudo systemctl enable ssh
Now start SSH service using this command:

sudo service ssh start
Allow Root Access
By default SSH won’t allow us to SSH login as root user. To allow root user access, open this file:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Then change PermitRootLogin value to yes:

From:
#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password

To:
PermitRootLogin yes
After that restart SSH service:

sudo service ssh restart
